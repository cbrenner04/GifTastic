## Superhero Giphys

The DOM is rendered with a default number of buttons and a form where you can
add as many buttons as you'd like. When a button (either the default or an
added button) is clicked, 10 Giphys will appear. The text in the button is what
is used to query Giphy. By default they appear still. You can click on any image
to make it animate. Click on it again to pause it.
